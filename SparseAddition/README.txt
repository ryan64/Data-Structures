--The function of this code is to add a matrix by another matrix of same size.  

HOW TO COMPILE: 

1. In the terminal, run the following command: g++ -Wall -std=c++11 sparse.cpp -o sparse
--This command will compile the sparse.cpp file. 

2. Next, run the following command: ./sparse "operation= ;storage= ;recursive= ;A=inputFileA.txt;B=inputFileB.txt;C=outputFile.txt"
--inputFileA.txt = the input file you're passing in as argument.
--inputFileB.txt = the second input file you're passing in as argument. 
--outputFile.txt = the output file you're writing to. 
--The input files is the name of the file you have in the directory, and the output file can be named whatever you wish.
